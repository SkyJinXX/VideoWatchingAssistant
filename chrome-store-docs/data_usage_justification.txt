DATA USAGE JUSTIFICATION
YouTube Watching Assistant v0.5.2

================================================================================
DATA COLLECTION OVERVIEW
================================================================================

The YouTube Watching Assistant extension collects and processes minimal data necessary for its core functionality. All data handling prioritizes user privacy and follows data minimization principles.

Data Types Collected:
1. Video metadata (title, ID, current timestamp)
2. Video subtitles and transcripts
3. User voice input for questions
4. User's OpenAI API key
5. User preferences and settings
6. Conversation history for context

================================================================================
DETAILED DATA USAGE ANALYSIS
================================================================================

1. VIDEO METADATA
   Collection: Video title, unique video ID, current playback timestamp
   Purpose: Provide context for AI responses and ensure answers are relevant to the specific video content
   Storage: Temporarily cached locally for current session only
   Transmission: Sent to OpenAI API as context for generating relevant responses
   Retention: Cleared when user navigates away from video
   User Control: Automatic collection only when extension is actively used

2. VIDEO SUBTITLES AND TRANSCRIPTS
   Collection: Subtitle text and timestamps from YouTube or subtitle services
   Purpose: Enable AI to understand video content and provide accurate answers to user questions
   Storage: Cached locally for 30 days to improve performance and reduce API calls
   Transmission: Sent to OpenAI API to provide video context for user questions
   Retention: 30-day automatic cleanup with user option to clear immediately
   User Control: Users can manually upload subtitles or disable automatic extraction

3. USER VOICE INPUT
   Collection: Audio recordings of user questions about video content
   Purpose: Convert speech to text for AI processing and question answering
   Storage: Temporarily processed in memory only, not permanently stored
   Transmission: Sent to OpenAI API for transcription and question processing
   Retention: Immediately discarded after processing, no persistent storage
   User Control: Explicit user action required for each recording

4. OPENAI API KEY
   Collection: User-provided API key for accessing OpenAI services
   Purpose: Authenticate user requests to OpenAI for AI-powered responses
   Storage: Encrypted storage in Chrome's secure storage API on user's device only
   Transmission: Sent securely to OpenAI API for authentication with each request
   Retention: Stored until user manually removes or uninstalls extension
   User Control: User provides key voluntarily, can remove or change at any time

5. USER PREFERENCES
   Collection: Settings such as enhanced voice mode preferences, UI language
   Purpose: Customize user experience and remember user's preferred interaction methods
   Storage: Stored locally in Chrome storage on user's device
   Transmission: Never transmitted to external servers
   Retention: Maintained until user changes settings or uninstalls extension
   User Control: User explicitly sets preferences, can modify at any time

6. CONVERSATION HISTORY
   Collection: Previous questions and AI responses for context in multi-turn conversations
   Purpose: Enable contextual follow-up questions and maintain conversation coherence
   Storage: Stored locally on user's device for 7 days maximum
   Transmission: Recent conversation context sent to OpenAI for maintaining conversation flow
   Retention: Automatic 7-day cleanup with user option to clear immediately
   User Control: Users can clear conversation history at any time

================================================================================
DATA MINIMIZATION PRACTICES
================================================================================

Minimal Collection:
- Only collects data essential for AI-powered video Q&A functionality
- No personal information beyond user-provided API key
- No tracking of user behavior outside of active extension usage
- No collection of browsing history or other browser data

Purpose Limitation:
- All data used exclusively for video Q&A functionality
- No data repurposing for analytics, advertising, or other secondary uses
- No data sharing with third parties beyond OpenAI for AI processing

Storage Minimization:
- Local storage preferred over cloud storage for user privacy
- Automatic cleanup policies prevent unnecessary data accumulation
- User controls for immediate data deletion

Processing Minimization:
- Voice input processed in memory without persistent storage
- Subtitle caching reduces redundant API calls and processing
- Efficient data structures minimize memory usage

================================================================================
THIRD-PARTY DATA SHARING
================================================================================

OpenAI API (Required for Core Functionality):
Data Shared: Video context (title, relevant subtitles), user questions, conversation history
Purpose: Generate AI-powered responses about video content
Legal Basis: Necessary for contracted service performance
User Control: Users provide explicit consent by configuring API key
Data Protection: Transmitted via HTTPS encryption, processed according to OpenAI's privacy policy

Subtitle Services (downsub.com, download.subtitle.to):
Data Shared: Video URL/ID for subtitle extraction
Purpose: Obtain video subtitles when not available through YouTube
Legal Basis: Necessary for core functionality
User Control: Automatic with user option to disable and use manual upload
Data Protection: Encrypted communication, no personal data transmitted

No Other Third-Party Sharing:
- No data shared with analytics services
- No advertising or marketing data sharing
- No data broker relationships
- No social media integration data sharing

================================================================================
USER RIGHTS AND CONTROLS
================================================================================

================================================================================
SECURITY MEASURES
================================================================================

Encryption:
- API keys encrypted in Chrome's secure storage
- All external communications use HTTPS
- Local data protected by browser security model

Access Controls:
- Extension only accesses data when user is actively using YouTube
- No background data collection when extension is inactive
- Minimal permission scope limits data access

Data Integrity:
